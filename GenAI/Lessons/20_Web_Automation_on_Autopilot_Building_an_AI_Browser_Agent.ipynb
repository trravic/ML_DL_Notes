A developer writes a script with explicit, step-by-step instructions for the browser to follow.

        "\n",
        "An AI browser agent's architecture allows it to perceive, reason, and act within a web environment:\n",
        "*   **Perception (The \"Eyes\")** The agent \"sees\" a webpage using a combination of methods. It analyzes the structural data, like the HTML or Document Object Model (DOM), to understand the page's layout and identify interactive elements. It also uses computer vision to analyze screenshots, allowing it to identify elements based on their appearance, just as a person would. This dual approach makes it more resilient to website changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Reasoning (The \"Brain\")** At its core is a Large Language Model (LLM), like GPT-4, which acts as the decision-making engine. The LLM interprets the user's goal, analyzes the data from the perception layer, and breaks the task down into a sequence of actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Actuation (The \"Hands\")** To perform actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling, the agent uses an underlying browser automation framework, such as Playwright or Selenium. The LLM decides *what* to do, and the framework executes *how* to do it.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process repeats in an \"observe-decide-act\" loop until the task is complete.\n",

        "*   **Web Scraping and Data Extraction** They can navigate multiple pages to extract and structure information, such as product details or contact lists.\n",
        "*   **Form Filling and Submission** Agents can intelligently fill out complex forms for tasks like signing up for services, applying for jobs, or getting insurance quotes.\n",
        "*   **Cross-Application Workflows** They can automate tasks that span multiple websites, such as taking a new follower from LinkedIn and adding them as a lead in Salesforce.\n",
        "*   **Complex Research** An agent can be tasked with open-ended research, like reading a CV, finding relevant jobs online, and saving them to a file."
